This folder contains a tarball of the simulations used to assess the performance
of LDhot and sequenceLDhot. The folders within the tarball are as follows.

MATLAB : Contains a MATLAB script for plotting the results of the simulations.
flat_n20 : Simulated data and results with a constant recombination rate and n=20.
flat_n20_sequenceLDhot : Same data as above, analyzed using sequenceLDhot.
hot_n20  : Simulated data with eight hotspots and n=20, and analyzed with LDhot.
hot_n20_sequenceLDhot  : Same data as above, analyzed using sequenceLDhot.
hot_n50  : The same eight hotspots, simulated with n=50, and analyzed with LDhot.
hot_n50_sequenceLDhot  : Same data as above, analyzed using sequenceLDhot.
